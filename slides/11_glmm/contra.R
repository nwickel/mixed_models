# Summary

# * From the data plot we can see a quadratic trend in the probability by age.
# * The patterns for women with children are similar and we do not need to
#   distinguish between 1, 2, and 3+ children.
# * We do distinguish between those women who do not have children and those
#   with children. This shows up in a significant age & children interaction
#   term.
