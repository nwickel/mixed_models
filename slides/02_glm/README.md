# R and workflow

* Install new R version (there is a new one each Halloween)

  RStudio is __not__ R!

* How to cite packages

* How can I see which packages are loaded? Installed?

* What is a vignette and where do I find it?

* Use `|>` not `%>%`; compare tidyverse style guide:
  https://style.tidyverse.org/

# TODOs

* Add slide with Binomial distribution
