# Intro

* All materials are here: https://nwickel.github.io/mixed_models/
  (Post into chat)

* Not strictly meant to be inverse class room, but it will be easier to follow
  along, when slides and exercises are prepared _before_ each session. (You have
  two weeks -- bring your questions! Maybe even bring data sets with similar
  structures.)

* This is the kind of material you will need to hear a couple of times before
  you start to feel like you "get" it.

# Let's start (with some basics)

I will start each session with a few general things on R and workflow

* How current are your R versions?

* Who uses RStudio? Other workflows?

* How to keep my installation clean

* How to update R, RStudio and packages

* Make Rstudio adjustments for a better workflow (do not save .Rhistory,
  important short cuts, customize, ...)

* Where are my packages?

* Show me all my packages with `library()` and `help.start()`
