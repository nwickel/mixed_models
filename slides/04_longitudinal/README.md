Intro to multilevel

The "analysis of multilevel data is difficult: it is easy to get apparently
strong statistical results from correlated errors, it is not always clear how to
perform simple sanity checks of complex analyses, and multilevel modeling
introduces its own challenges."

Gelman & Brown (2024, p. 2)
