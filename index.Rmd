# Course information {-}

This is an online book accompanying a course on mixed-effects models taught to
PhD students at the Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien (IWM) in Tübingen.

So far, this is _work in progress_ and very rudimentary!

## Desirable background knowledge {-}

Alle examples in this course are worked out in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
Introductory knowledge in R is therefore a prerequisite. If you want to freshen
up your R knowledge a bit, you can go through the exercises provided here:
https://nwickel.github.io/R_intro/. Apart from this, I will assume that you have
some kind of workflow how to use R with a text editor (e.g.,
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/)) or an IDE (e.g.,
[RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)).

It is further assumed that you have attended at least one introductory
statistics course (level "Statisik I" and "Statistik II" usually taught in
psychology curricula at German universities). That means you should be familiar
with concepts like random variables, statstical distributions like the normal
distribution, t distribution, Binomial distribution, etc., and hypothesis
testing. Some background in regression analysis is helpful, but we will cover
the basics of this in this course.

If you feel like these concepts could be a bit more "present" in your head, you
can go through the first Section in the online book by @Vasishth2022. There will
be time to ask questions about all of these concepts in this session, but we
will not have time to got through all the concepts together.

Hopefully, these resources will help to get everybody on the same page. If you
need more support or materials, just let me know.
