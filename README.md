# Course on Mixed-effects Models

This repository contains slides and materials I use to teach a PhD course on
mixed-effects models at the Leibniz-Insitut für Wissensmedien (IWM) in Tübingen.

I recently changed the structure of the course and created html pages with
`bookdown` accompanying the course that contain the slides and exercises.

This is still work _in progress_.
