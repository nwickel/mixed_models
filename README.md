# Course on Mixed-effects Models

This repository contains slides and materials I use to teach a PhD course on
mixed-effects models at the Leibniz-Insitut für Wissensmedien (IWM) in Tübingen.

I recently changed the structure of the course and created html pages with
`bookdown` accompanying the course that contain the slides and exercises. This
is still work in progress and not done, yet!

# TODOs

* In `\statistics_seminar\slides\` I have much more examples for mixed-effects
  models which should be integrated in this course
* This will become a whole semester course with about 12-14 sessions with
  this additional material
* For the methods seminar you can either pick some of the sessions or
  spread it over two semesters
* There are also tons of exercises which should be included in these
  sessions
