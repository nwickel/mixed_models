# Additional topics

* In
  C:\Users\nwickelmaier\Nextcloud\Documents\teaching\2019\statistics_seminar\slides\
  I have much more examples for mixed-effects models which should be
  integrated in this course
* This will become a whole semester course with about 12-14 sessions with
  this additional material
* For the methods seminar you can either pcik some of the sessions or
  spread it over two semesters
* There are also tons of exercises which should be included in these
  sessions!
